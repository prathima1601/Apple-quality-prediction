# Apple-quality-prediction
Currently, fruit quality assessment in the agricultural industry is primarily conducted through manual inspection and traditional testing methods. These methods include:

1. Visual Inspection: Farmers and experts evaluate the appearance, color, and shape of apples based on experience and predefined quality standards.

2. Weight and Size Measurement: Mechanical weighing scales and calipers are used to determine the weight and size of apples.

3. Chemical Analysis: Laboratory tests are performed to measure acidity and nutrient content, which can be time-consuming and costly.

4. Non-Automated Data Recording: Data collected from various quality assessments are often recorded manually, increasing the chances of human error.

The drawbacks of the existing system include:

· Subjectivity and inconsistency in quality assessment

· High dependency on human expertise

· Time-consuming and labor-intensive processes

· Lack of real-time automated analysis


Proposed System

The proposed system integrates AI and sensor technology to automate and enhance apple quality assessment. The key components of the system are:

1. Hardware Components:

o Arduino Uno: Acts as the central controller for interfacing with sensors.

o Ultrasonic Sensor: Measures the size of the apple.

o Load Cell-Based Weight Sensor: Determines the weight of the apple.

o Color Sensor: Analyzes the juice color to assess freshness and ripeness.

o pH Sensor: Measures the acidity level of extracted apple juice.

o NPK Sensor: Detects nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium content in the juice.

o OLED Display: Provides real-time data feedback to users.

2. Software Components:

o Python-Based Application: Developed using Flask framework for a user-friendly web interface.

o Machine Learning Algorithms:

§ Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP): A neural network model for classification.

§ Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble learning method for accurate prediction.

o Data Collection and Labeling: The system fetches sensor data and autofills forms for easy dataset generation. Users label data on a scale of 1 to 5 based on quality.

o Model Training and Evaluation: Users can train the machine learning model with the collected dataset and evaluate its accuracy through the web UI.

o Prediction System: After training, users can test unknown apples by fetching real-time sensor data and classifying their quality using the trained model.

Advantages of the Proposed System:

· Automation: Eliminates manual intervention, reducing human error.

· Accuracy: AI-based classification enhances the reliability of quality assessment.

· Efficiency: Reduces time and labor involved in fruit quality evaluation.

· Scalability: Can be extended to assess other fruits and agricultural products.

This AI-enabled apple quality detection system presents a cost-effective and scalable solution for the agricultural industry, ensuring high-quality fruit selection while reducing dependency on traditional labor-intensive methods.
